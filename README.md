## 📌 Project Overview  
This is a simple *Python-based Alarm Clock* application that allows the user to set an alarm by entering hours and minutes. When the system time matches the alarm time, a *voice alert* is triggered using the pyttsx3 text-to-speech library.

The project demonstrates the use of:  
- Loops  
- Condition checking  
- Time and datetime modules  
- Text-to-speech (TTS) in Python  
- Basic Python logic building
