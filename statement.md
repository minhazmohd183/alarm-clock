## 📝 1. Introduction  
This project is a simple and functional *Python-based Alarm Clock* designed to allow users to set a specific time for an audio alert. It uses Python’s built-in datetime and time modules to continuously monitor system time and the pyttsx3 text-to-speech library to generate a spoken alarm notification.

---

## 🎯 2. Aim of the Project  
To design and implement a real-time alarm clock in Python that triggers a voice alert when the system time matches the user-defined alarm time.

---

## 🎯 3. Objectives  
- To understand the use of Python's *datetime* and *time* modules.  
- To demonstrate the implementation of a *real-time clock* in Python.  
- To integrate the *pyttsx3 text-to-speech* library for an audible alarm.  
- To apply loops, condition checks, and basic automation concepts.  
- To build a simple utility program that works offline.

## 📌 4. Problem Statement  
In daily life, we often require a simple way to set alarms without depending on mobile applications or internet-based tools. This project attempts to solve this by creating an *offline Python alarm clock* that can run on any system and alert users at a specified time through voice output.

---

## 🛠 5. Scope of the Project  
- Can be expanded into a full desktop application using Tkinter.  
- Additional features like stopwatch, multiple alarms, or sound selection can be added.  
- Demonstrates a real-life use case of Python programming for beginners.

---

## 📚 6. Tools & Technologies Used  
- *Python 3.x*  
- datetime module  
- time module  
- pyttsx3 (Text-to-Speech engine)

---

## 🔧 7. Working Principle  
1. The user enters an alarm time (hours and minutes).  
2. The program continuously checks the current system time.  
3. When the current time matches the alarm time, the program triggers a voice alert using pyttsx3.  
4. The alarm stops after speaking the alert message.

## 📘 8. Learning Outcomes  
- Ability to work with Python’s built-in modules.  
- Understanding how to handle time-based operations.  
- Learning to implement TTS (text-to-speech) in Python.  
- Improving logical thinking using loops and conditionals.  
- Experience with creating runnable real-world Python projects.

## ✔ 9. Conclusion  
The Python Alarm Clock project successfully demonstrates how Python can be used to create simple yet effective real-time
